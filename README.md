# Description:
This website was setup with Django 4.0, Jinja templating, handles files and static asssets easily using the updated Django 4.0 documentation and finally comes with the good old Django admin dashboard. It beeen long since I worked on the project since I 
was told to focus on another project ðŸ˜Œ. Just think of this as an initial scaffolding or setup. In the future, if I get to work on the project again, I will be implementing alot of Django template inheritance to make life alot easier for other Developers that will be working with the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files ðŸ˜‰.

# Getting Started
To look at my simple setup and run the project on your computer, start with seetting up a virtual environment for your local computer.
Run this code: `python3 -m venv venv`. Start the virtual environment with this command for mac: `source venv/bin/activate`. Once you activate the virtual environment, simply run this command `pip3 install django`. Finally, run the project using this command: `python3 manage.py runserver`.

# Disclaimer.
This project is for testing and demonstration purposes only.
